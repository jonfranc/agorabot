\b octomap_ros provides conversion functions between ROS/PCL and OctoMap in conversions.h. 
It also provides a templated wrapper class octomap::OctomapROS\<OctreeT\> which does the converions
for you. In most cases, the wrapper octomap::OcTreeROS should be what you are looking for if you
want to use the default OctoMap OcTree in ROS, e.g. for occupancy mapping.

\section codeapi Code API

<!--
Provide links to specific auto-generated API documentation within your
package that is of particular interest to a reader. Doxygen will
document pretty much every part of your code, so do your best here to
point the reader to the actual API.

If your codebase is fairly large or has different sets of APIs, you
should use the doxygen 'group' tag to keep these APIs together. For
example, the roscpp documentation has 'libros' group.
